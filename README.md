Tournois Games

This is a small and a simple project to train us to work as a team.

The word Tournois is a French word for turnament.

We decide to work in agil way, which will start with a simple and basic program, and will elevate the functionalities to intermediate and try to make the program more interesting for the user

The initial/basic consep:
- A user will start the program or play by start or run the program
- The computer will propose the choices of creatures (we start with 3 different creatures)
- once the the user chose one creature, the program will display the name of the creature its specifications. 
- at the same time, the program will start the game automatically:
      the player will start with level 1, and will have 10 lives.
      the computer will repeatidly, give 1 or -1 randomly until the player lives reach 0. --> 1 meaning computer winning against player, and -1 is the oposite
      every time the computer win, the player lose 1 live
      every time the computer lose, the player win a level
- the program ended when the player lives reach 0, and will display the level of the player automatically
